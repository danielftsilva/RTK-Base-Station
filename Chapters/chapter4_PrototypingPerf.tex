\chapter{Prototyping and Performance Evaluation Results}\label{cha:chapter4_PrototypingPerf}

So neste capitulo e que se deve descrever a operacao do circuito.

It should be noted that, for the top and bottom FET selection stage, the Si7212DN model suggested is a double FET in one package. The CSD17308Q3 substituting model is a single-channel FET (only one per package), and therefore two units had to be acquired -- Section~\ref{sec:3211_LTC4012}.

%ate agora foram os unicos MOSFETs que nao disse o nome:

%como nao foi relevante, ate agora ainda nao disse que MOSFETs selecionei para o power switch: Q4 e Q5.
%Q3, Q10, Q6, Q8 -- BQ29209

% AP64501:
Recalling Section~\ref{sec:3214_AP64501}, it is stated that the closest commercially available values of 11k$\Omega$ and 2.7k$\Omega$ were selected for R10 and R13, respectively, at the prototyping phase. Following expressions (\ref{eq:R10}) and (\ref{eq:R13}), these values allow the expected $V_{ON}$ and $V_{OFF}$ values.

    Peak current determines the required saturation current rating, which influences the size of the inductor. Saturating the inductor decreases the converter efficiency while increasing the temperatures of the inductor and the internal power MOSFETs. Therefore, choosing an inductor with the appropriate saturation current rating is important. 
    It is recommended by \cite{AP64501} the selection of an inductor value between $1 \mu$H to $10 \mu$H, and therefore, taking into account the values presented in Table~\ref{tab:AP64501_recommended_values}, an inductor of $3.6 \mu$H was selected. It is also advised to select an indcutor with a DC current rating of at least 35\% higher than the maximum 5A load current of the AP64501, which corresponds to 6.75A.
    For highest efficiency, the inductor's DC resistance should be less than 10mOhm. Use a larger inductance for improved efficiency under light load conditions.
