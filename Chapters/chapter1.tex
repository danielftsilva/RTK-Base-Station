\chapter{Description of the Problem}\label{cha:introduction_description}

Around twelve thousand years ago, the way of life of the average human being changed completely (until then, it simply followed primitive and sometimes unproductive ways of hunting). % citation needed
The domestication of plants and breeding of animals started the Neolithic period, which was based on the revolution of a great base: Agriculture.

Over the years, the agricultural exploration made possible the discovery and invention of countless phenomena and techniques, many of which are practiced and improved until the present day, since this is, precisely, a primitive area in itself.
However, the doors of this type of exploration are far from being closed, and the machines are already able to complement and facilitate human work in the agricultural sector with much more efficiency. But there is still a great ally for such efficiency, which sometimes goes unnoticed or is even forgotten: Image Processing.
