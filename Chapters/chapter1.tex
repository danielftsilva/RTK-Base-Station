\chapter{Introduction}\label{cha:I_introduction}

%mudar o começo desta frase -> tirar os parenteses
Around twelve thousand years ago, the way of life of the average human being -- which, until then, simply followed primitive and sometimes unproductive ways of hunting -- changed completely. The domestication of plants and breeding of animals started in the Neolithic period, which paved the way for the revolution and subsequent development of agriculture~\cite{Zeder2011TheOO}.

The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 introduced the first ever mechanisation of an agricultural process, resulting immediately in enormous volumes of production, quickly enriching societies around the globe~\cite{Roe1926}.
This resulted in a new age in agriculture that continues to this day, where machines are created and improved in order to efficiently complement and facilitate human work in almost every process possible.
However, some tasks remain relatively tedious (such as pesticide sprayers mounted on tractors) or are just too inefficient, despite the use of machines. Robotics-oriented devices are able to patch the holes in both cases, notably in the latter.
%falar de infraestruturas e segurança agora
It is also quite obvious that work of this nature is not exclusive to the agricultural sector; there are thousands of people responsible for jobs regarding an important and sometimes overlooked need of society: surveillance.
Taking the example of developing projects % ir ao site da aeriya ver o que o drone faz; meter aqui
workplace accidents or, in a more drastic approach, Siberia's sadly expected annual wildfires (which, in 2021, reported the most devastating one of the 21$^{st}$ century~\cite{dixon_2021,roth_2021}), the mitigation of situations that could, possibly, negatively impact human life is undoubtedly imperative.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

With rapid technological advancement, a factor foreseen to be virtually removed was, precisely, the human contribution. Thus, when developing a device capable of performing tasks that, normally, a human would be responsible for, the main focus should be envisioning how each of those could be performed by it.

Sight is more than often the most important sense to consider, therefore, bearing all of this in mind, a device capable of ``seeing'', acknowledging and mapping an area of work would be an excellent starting point for the previously mentioned sectors. Nowadays, tasks like these can be performed by devices known as ``Unmanned Aerial Vehicles'' (or UAVs), designed for a vast array of functions.

When using UAVs, constantly having to manually control them in tedious and lengthy tasks (e.g. agricultural field surveying) might be impractical.
A solution for this type of problem would be to automate the processes assigned to the devices. For that, one can't only rely on GPS for extremely precise positioning, specially in a real-time scenario, since this service only provides a few meters of accuracy and not the level needed for precise navigation, which must be in the order of centimeters. Real-time kinematics (RTK) solves this issue~\cite{gps_USGov,8714161},
since it is a technology designed to improve the accuracy of GNSS receivers in real time. This means it perfectly fits the high precision need of autonomous vehicles, imperative to carry out certain missions with virtually to no human assistance. Therefore, high accuracy is absolutely necessary in real-time UAV positioning.
% AND LANDING OF THE DRONE ?????????????
However, as this type of equipment is in constant motion, the problem of obtaining highly precise position readings in real time arises, which in turn calls for a solution that is capable of providing such readings -- a base station.

% What is a Base Station?         meter isto:?
% In the context of external land surveying, a base station is a GPS receiver at an accurately-known fixed location which is used to derive correction information for nearby portable GPS receivers. This correction data allows propagation and other effects to be corrected out of the position data obtained by the mobile stations, which gives greatly increased location precision and accuracy over the results obtained by uncorrected GPS receivers.
A UAV used in external land surveying (for precision agriculture or surveillance, for example) usually includes a GNSS receiver integrated in its board which, just like a regular smartphone, helps tracking down its current position.
However, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:I_description}, the offered precision is not the best for real-time applications.
To solve this issue, an equipment known as ``base station'' can be used as a position adjustment auxiliary.
Also containing a GNSS receiver itself, a base station is stationary and, through a link to the vast array of satellites arranged in outer space (also known as constellations), is able to send position corrections to another GNSS receiver linked to it (usually a rover, e.g. a UAV), in a real-time manner.
In order for this to be possible, the base station must be fixed and have information regarding its exact position, which can be determined directly from a GNSS constellation or through the internet.
As soon as that is established, the corrections made by it will be extremely trustworthy and precise.

% The Problem to Solve
This dissertation aims at the redesign of the RTK base station produced by the company in collaboration with\footnote{Beyond Vision (\url{https://beyond-vision.pt/index}).}. This product is known as beRTK\textsuperscript{\textregistered}~\cite{beRTK_2022}, and currently has two main functions: the first is to use a high precision GNSS module known as ZED-F9P, in order to obtain its position in a highly precise manner and then broadcasting RTK corrections via radiofrequency to a UAV\footnote{Beyond Vision's HEIFU\textsuperscript{\textregistered} (\url{https://beyond-vision.pt/heifu}).} -- this radiofrequency link can be established either through another module, known as ZigBee, or through a LoRa protocol\footnote{Addressed in Chapter~\ref{cha:II_SotA}.};
the second is to connect itself to an NTRIP network in order to obtain its precise location much faster (as, through pure GNSS positioning (in this case, GPS), obtaining a precision value below 10 centimeters takes a long time -- up to hours; relying on NTRIP reduces that same waiting time to just minutes or even seconds).
The proposed idea for this Dissertation is to work on lowering the power consumption of the solution -- currently developed by Beyond Vision -- the best way possible. For that, the device will have to be redesigned.

The current solution manages Wi-Fi connections through a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, a single-board computer (SBC) with two Wi-Fi modules:
one able to connect the base station to a Wi-Fi network and fetch positioning data from the NTRIP network, and another that enables the remote configuration of the base from a web-based application, through the creation of a local network.
It is, therefore, intended to replace the used SBC with microcontrollers able to perform these same operations, while keeping both the high precision GNSS module and the module used for the radiofrequency broadcasting of RTK corrections.
Also on the list of changes, yet with lower priority, is a more robust battery system -- that allows charging and using the base at the same time (preferably via USB Type-C). The power consumption of this sector is intended to be cut in approximately half.
