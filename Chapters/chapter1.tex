\chapter{Introduction}\label{cha:I_introduction}

%mudar o começo desta frase -> tirar os parenteses
Around twelve thousand years ago, the way of life of the average human being -- which, until then, simply followed primitive and sometimes unproductive ways of hunting -- changed completely. The domestication of plants and breeding of animals started in the Neolithic period, which paved the way for the revolution and subsequent development of agriculture~\cite{Zeder2011TheOO}.

Over the years, the discovery of countless phenomena as well as the development of numerous techniques have been made possible by exploring this laborous sector, and the doors that lead to the exploration seem far from being closed.

The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 introduced the first ever mechanisation of an agricultural process, resulting immediately in enormous volumes of production, quickly enriching societies around the globe~\cite{Roe1926}.
This resulted in a new age in agriculture that continues to this day, where machines are created and improved in order to efficiently complement and facilitate human work in almost every process possible.
However, some tasks remain relatively tedious (such as pesticide sprayers mounted on tractors) or are just too inefficient, despite the use of machines. Robotics-oriented devices are able to patch the holes in both situations, notably in the latter.

With the rapid technological advancement, a factor foreseen to be virtually removed was, precisely, the human contribution. Thus, when developing a device capable of performing tasks that, normally, a human would do, the main focus should be envisioning how each of those tasks could be performed by that given device. In agriculture, for example, sight is (arguably) the most important sense to consider, therefore, S

But there is still a great ally for such efficiency, which sometimes goes unnoticed is even forgotten: Image Processing.

    9. GNSS - "The performance of GNSS is assessed using four criteria: Accuracy, Integrity, Continuity and Availability. The correlated range errors due to ephemeris prediction errors and residual satellite clock, ionosphere and troposphere errors may vary slowly with time and user location.
    Therefore, by comparing pseudo-range measurements with those made by equipment at a presurveyed location, known as a REFERENCE STATION or BASE STATION, the correlated range errors may be calibrated out, improving the navigation-solution Accuracy! This is the priciple behind Differential GNSS (DGNSS)~\cite{edseee_9101092}. % fazer desenho .svg de base station a "acertar" o drone com os satelites

    land surveying - In the context of external land surveying, a base station is a GPS receiver at an accurately-known fixed location which is used to derive correction information for nearby portable GPS receivers. This correction data allows propagation and other effects to be corrected out of the position data obtained by the mobile stations, which gives greatly increased location precision and accuracy over the results obtained by uncorrected GPS receivers.

    how long does it take for a radio signal to be emitted from a satellite to reach the surface of the earth? 
    R.: given that a satellite circles the globe at an altitude of about 19.3 km --> d = v*t => 19.3*10$^3$ / 300 000 000 = t = 6.43*10$^{-5}$ = 64.3 us.
