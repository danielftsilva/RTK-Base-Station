\section{If You Use this Template…} 
\label{sub:if_you_use_this_template}

This Chapter presents an introduction to the template and how it is organized. In the next chapter you can find some specific instructions. Please read the next sections carefully.

Someone spent a few dozens of hours working on this template to make your life easier and to allow you to be more productive.  Those working hours were not paid and were “stolen” from family.
If you use this template, please go to the
\href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis_word}{project web page in GitHub}
and:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cite it \cite{novathesis-manual} in your thesis/dissertation with “\verb!\cite{novathesis-manual}!”, any place you think it makes sense.  If you cite it this way, the correct entry will be added automatically to your bibliography (there no need to add it to your BibTeX file);
  \item Give the project a star (marked with a red ellipse at the top-right in Figure~\ref{fig:github}); and
  \item Make a small donation (marked with a red ellipse at the bottom-left in Figure~\ref{fig:github}).
\end{enumerate}

The \gls{novathesis} was initially directed to the PhD and MSc students thesis at \gls{DI} of the \gls{FCT} of the \gls{NOVA}, Portugal, but currently it supports other Universities and Schools, namely:

\section{Getting Started}
\label{sec:getting_started}

The template provides an \emph{easy-to-use} setting for you to write your thesis/dissertation in \LaTeX:

\subsection{Using Overleaf}\label{sub:using_overleaf}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\linewidth}
\vspace*{-15ex}\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{overleaf}
\end{wrapfigure}

If you do not have an account in \href{https://www.overleaf.com?r=f5160636&rm=d&rs=b}{Overleaf}, you must \href{https://www.overleaf.com?r=f5160636&rm=d&rs=b}{create one first}.

Once you have an account, please access the \glsxtrlong{novathesis} in \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/new-university-of-lisbon-universidade-nova-de-lisboa-slash-unl-thesis-template/fwbztcrptjmg}{Overleaf} and select the green button \emph{Open as Template}. 

\emph{Please note that the version currently available in Overleaf (v4.1.3) is outdated. A new version will be submitted to Overleaf soon.}  

\subsection{Using a Local \LaTeX\ Installation}
\label{sub:using_local_latex}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\linewidth}
\vspace*{-15ex}\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{github}%
\end{wrapfigure}

Just access the \glsxtrlong{novathesis} in \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis}{GitHub}, select the green button \emph{Code} and then \emph{download} (or \emph{clone}) the template.  You will always get the latest version of the template (currently v5.1.8).
